            <h2>PUP Quezon City</h2>
            <p>Started as petitions to have a higher educational institution for the youth at the National Government Center area from the community organizations and church groups and negotiations with local officials and other government agencies, the PUP Quezon City Campus is a pantheon of concrete success towards the struggle in people’s fight against ignorance. As enshrined on the Deed of Assignment on 24 March 1997, that is, “to establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP.” Since its establishment in 1997, PUP Quezon City continues to produce quality and globally competitive graduates in the areas of education, information technology, management, marketing, entrepreneurship and office management technology.</p>
            <p>The PUP Quezon City Campus, formerly PUP Commonwealth Campus, is a 1.9-hectare forested land area and was assigned, transferred and endorsed to the Polytechnic University of the Philippines as ASSIGNEE by the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council-National Government Center Housing Committee (HUDCC-NGCHC), a government entity created by Executive Order No. 90 and with expanded functions under RA 7279 and Home Insurance And Guaranty Corporation (HIGC) as Assignor, a government owned and controlled corporation created under RA 580 and presently located at Don Fabian Street, Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City.</p>
