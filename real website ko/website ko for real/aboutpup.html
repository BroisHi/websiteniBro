                    <p>This institution started as the Manila Business School (MBS), founded in October 19, 1904 as part of the city school system under the superintendence of C.A. O'Reilley, which responds to the demand for training personnel for government service and the felt need to provide skills essential for private employment. In 1908, it was renamed as Philippine School of Commerce (PSC) and merged with the Philippine Normal School (PNS) in 1933 to 1946. By virtue of Republic Act 778, the PSC was again changed to Philippine College of Commerce (PCC) in 1952. Subsequently, the Philippine College of Commerce (PCC) was converted into a chartered state university, now known as the Polytechnic University of the Philippines by virtue of Presidential Decree Number 1341 issued by the President of the Philippines on April 1, 1978.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>PUP is a public, non-sectarian, non-profit institution of higher learning primarily tasked with harnessing the tremendous human resources potential of the nation by improving the physical, intellectual and material well-being of the individual through higher occupational, technical and professional instruction and training in the applied arts and sciences related to the fields of commerce, business administration, and technology.</p>
